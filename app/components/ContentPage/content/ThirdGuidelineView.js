      <h1>Guideline 3: Implications of scenarios</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Scenarios shouldn’t be made just for the sake of making scenarios. The learnings from the scenario work should always be incorporated into the actual strategy making process. So in this step, the scenario work is taken back to the actual strategy process.</p>
        <p>The scenarios include both opportunities and threats, so it’s necessary to understand those and think about how to best prepare for them in terms of seizing the opportunities and to brace for the threats.</p>
        <h2>Opportunities and threats assessment</h2>
        <p>Are there common challenges or opportunities across the different scenarios? These are the most likely things that should be incorporated in the region’s strategy in one way or another.</p>
        <h2>Preparation plan template</h2>
        <p>The Preparation plan template helps to understand what should be done in case one of the scenarios actually realise and fathom if there are similar challenges or opportunities. The top part of the template should be filled in first. All of the Scenario preparation description boxes are filled with challenges, opportunities and how to prepare for them.</p>
        <p>Then next the common challenges and opportunities from the scenarios are filled in in the lowest text box of the template. Here it’s crucial to think what preparatory actions could be taken in any case. It’s also good to evaluate if there are especially impactful uncertainties that could be taken into account in the overall strategy.</p>

          <h2>Create indicators</h2>
          <p>It might be beneficial to create early indicators for each of the scenarios, especially if there are great underlying opportunities or threats that could be prepared for in advance. By studying the development of selected uncertainties in the future the region might be able to seize future opportunities or prepare for threats so that the challenges are minimised.</p>
