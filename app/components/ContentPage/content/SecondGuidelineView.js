        <h1>Guideline 2: Developing scenarios</h1>
        <div>
          <p>This guideline helps regional policy-makers to turn the previously gathered trends and uncertainties into scenarios that will give great insight to how the future scenarios could be taken into account in RIS3.</p>
          <p>The scenarios are built based on the uncertainties and trends listed in the previous PEST-template. The uncertainties are assessed regarding their impact/importance for the region and their relative uncertainty in the Impact analysis template. The Impact analysis template requires regions to assess the levels of uncertainty and impact of each uncertainty. This can be done either through a regional workshop or a Delphi survey.</p>
          <p>Then the most uncertain and important uncertainties are selected using the selected and Scenario building template is used to form the scenarios. Here the idea is to form 4 distinct scenarios using two key uncertainties.</p>
          <p>When the presumptions for different scenarios are ready, the scenarios are described in detail. This can be done by using the Scenario description template. Clear and elaborative descriptions of the scenarios are a vital part in forming scenarios. Engaging scenarios will give more to think about and fascinate participants to think more about how the region should anticipate different possible futures.</p>
          <h2>This is not the only way to form scenarios</h2>
          <p>While our templates are helpful for forming scenarios, the above is not the only way in which scenarios can be built. The basic idea of having uncertainties and trends as the foundation of scenario building is the same with all scenario building styles.</p>
          <h2>Impact analysis template</h2>
          <p>The Impact analysis template is used to figure out which gathered uncertainties are the most important ones. The most important uncertainties will become the base of scenario building, thus it’s important to analyse all uncertainties in terms of uncertainty and impact.</p>
          <h3>How uncertain and impactful the uncertainties are?</h3>
          <p>At this point, after the PEST-analysis and data gathering, there should be quite a number of uncertainties to assess. All the uncertainties are assessed in terms of their uncertainty and impact on the region.</p>
          <p><strong>Uncertainty</strong></p>
          <p>Uncertainty is high in those uncertainties which could have almost any outcome – and the outcome in the future cannot be predicted with the current knowledge. When uncertainties are high, it’s especially important to think about how to prepare for the possible outcomes.</p>
          <p>In our template the uncertainty is measured on a scale of 0 to 10. 10 means that the outcome of an uncertainty is not at all sure with the current knowledge and 0 meaning that the outcome is predictable. Thus, uncertainties with the uncertainty level of 0 are not really uncertain at all and they should be called trends instead.</p>
          <p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
          <p>Some uncertainties don’t affect much the region whichever the outcome. Thus, it’s not much use to assess these in the scenario building. Instead, some uncertainties can pose great opportunities or be detrimental to the region.</p>
          <p>In the Impact analysis template, the impact is likewise measured on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 being completely indifferent and 10 conveying the greatest impact possible.</p>
          <h3>How should the impact/uncertainty assessment be done?</h3>
          <p>This impact/uncertainty assessment should take regional actors’ opinions into account. It’s highly recommended to utilise workshops or Delphi surveys in determining the levels of impact and uncertainty because regional actors and experts most likely have the most up to data insights on the uncertainties. This is also a great way to engage RIS3 stakeholders in the RIS3 process.</p>
          <p>It might also be beneficial to map the identified trends in the impact analysis template as well. The trends should be somewhat certain and score low in uncertainty. However, the impact of the trends for the region might vary greatly. Thus, the trends that have a great impact could be selected as presumptions for all scenarios in the next template.</p>
          <h3>Which uncertainties should be taken into scenarios?</h3>
          <p>The most impactful and uncertain uncertainties are the most important uncertainties that should be selected to building scenarios. Two of them should be then selected for the scenario building.</p>
          <p>If there are multiple uncertainties that could be selected (as there most likely will be) the scenario building facilitators may select the most appropriate ones.</p>
          <p>The below Figure 5 shows how uncertainties and trends should be seen in the impact analysis template. Important uncertainties are those that should be incorporated in the scenario building presumptions.</p>

          <h2>Scenario building template</h2>
          <p>Scenario building template helps with visualising the presumptions for each scenario. In this scenario building approach, 4 distinct scenarios are built with two uncertainties. There are other types of approaches as well, see more from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adgo/scenario-building-workshop-how-to-build-and-use-scenarios">here</a>.</p>
          <p>When the two main uncertainties are selected, they are put on a matrix. Our template requires the naming of both uncertainties and writing short descriptions of what the outcome possibilities for each uncertainty are.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>What are extreme outcomes?</h3>
          <p>Extreme outcomes for each uncertainty are what could happen in the extreme case with the uncertainty. The point is not to make these outcomes still credible in the decided time frame.</p>
          <p>For example, if regional safety is the uncertainty possible outcomes could be (1) greatly lowered safety in terms of terrorism, IT security and the number of conflicts and (2) improved safety with fewer security problems, terrorism and conflicts due to improved international collaboration against terrorism and conflicts and improved IT security.</p>
          <p>When you make combinations of different uncertainty outcomes, you end up with 4 distinct presumptions for the scenarios.</p>
          <h2>Scenario description template</h2>
          <p>Scenario description template can be used to form detailed descriptions for the scenarios, building on the presumptions from the Scenario building template. However, to form more elaborative scenario descriptions, it’s advised to use a richer media (such as PowerPoint slides for example) than the Scenario Description templates. This template is none-the-less great for initial scenario descriptions.</p>
          <p>Like the previous PDF templates, Scenario description template can be filled in in most PDF readers, editors and in most internet browsers. There are two types of Scenario description templates, one with only text fields and another with one image field per scenario.</p>

          <h3>Elaborative Scenarios</h3>
          <p>It’s important that scenarios are elaborative and interesting. The more intriguing the scenarios are, the more they tease out creative thinking, solutions and preparation plans in the next phase. Thus, good scenarios should include storylines and detailed portrayals of what life is like in the region in the scenario.</p>
          <p>This elaboration should also include visualisations of the scenarios. So the description could actually include images, comics, videos and other kinds of visual aids.</p>
          <h3>Checklist for Scenarios</h3>
          <p><em>Are the scenarios plausible?</em><br /><em> Is there a logical chain of events that would lead to each of the scenarios?</em><br /><em>If the scenarios really happen, what else needs to happen?</em> (For example, if the scenario is based on the presumption that there will be more internet security problems it’s necessary to incorporate a reason for that)<br /><em>Are the scenarios internally consistent?</em> There shouldn’t be any events or drivers that exclude one another.</p>
          <p><em>Are the scenarios differentiated from one another?</em></p>
          <p><em>Do scenarios challenge the conventional thinking or are they somewhat unsurprising?</em><br />Scenarios should shed light on unconventional possibilities and help the region to prepare for things that are not already expected.</p>
          <p><em>Are the scenario titles descriptive?</em></p>
          <p><em>Are the storylines fascinating?</em></p>
          <p><em>Are there any visual materials to elaborate the scenarios?</em></p>
          <p>It’s also beneficial to do an actor analysis in this step. So think about different stakeholders in the scenario and assess their interests. Are there groups of people who benefit or would drive this scenario? If a scenario is the worst option for all interest groups it’s not very likely to be a plausible scenario.</p>
          <p>Note here that scenarios shouldn’t be assessed regarding their probability. Thus, there shouldn’t be any probabilities or probability analyses in the scenario descriptions.</p>
