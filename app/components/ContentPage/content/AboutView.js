        <h1>Scenario building tool</h1>
        <p>The scenario building starts with the determination of the scope of the scenario work. In the context of RIS3, it may be how the nation/region will evolve in the next 20-30 years related to political, environmental, social and technological issues.</p>
        <p>The application consists of three different sets of guidelines, which support regions to conduct scenario work. The application thus essentially assist regions to carry out scenario process.</p>
        <p>The first set of guidelines supports regions to identify trends and uncertainties affecting regional development. It provides a list of data sources for regions to identify trends and uncertainties on the European level. The regions can use this data as the basis to identify further trends and uncertainties on the regional level.</p>
        <p>The second set of guidelines supports to develop and describe a set of future scenarios. The basis for scenario development is derived from the identified future uncertainties. Regional stakeholders are to assess their level of importance and their level of uncertainty. This can be done through online Delphi application or in a workshop. Then, the region is to select the most important and uncertain uncertainties for the basis of scenarios. The guideline provides a set of questions that can be used to build scenarios in a way that they are consistently different, and to describe the different scenarios in a clear and appealing manner to raise the interest and the ability for regional stakeholders to assess them.</p>
        <p>The third set of guidelines supports regions to assess the implications of scenarios. For this, it is possible to use online Delphi application or to conduct a regional workshop. The aim of the assessment is to support the region to prepare an action plan how to exploit the foreseen opportunities and to minimize risks. The guideline provides a set of questions that can be used to assess the implications of scenarios.</p>

        <h1>Scenario building process</h1>
        <p>As a whole, scenario process involves the following 5 steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify future trends and uncertainties (PEST analysis template)</li>
          <li>Assess the importance of each trend and uncertainty (Impact analysis template)</li>
          <li>Form scenarios (Scenario building template)</li>
          <li>Describe scenarios in-depth (Scenario description template)</li>
          <li>Assess scenario implications and plan for preparatory actions (Preparation plan template)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Online S3 templates for scenario building support each of these steps. The steps are divided into three guidelines. Step 1 is described in Guideline 1, Steps 2 to 4 are described in Guideline 2 and Step 5 is described in Guideline 3. Hence, the three guidelines help with each stage in the scenario building process.</p>
        <p>The first step is for RIS3 facilitators (regional planners) to formulate the scope for scenario building. Typically, this is related to how the region will develop during the next 20-30 years. Then the first step involves identifying key trends and uncertainties affecting regional development such as political, economic, social and technological issues. RIS3 facilitators can get this data from different ways through preparing a desktop research, a workshop or a Delphi survey targeted for regional specialists. Scenario building tool offers a list of data sources that support the collection of trends and uncertainties in European level such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cluster/observatory/european-cluster-trend-report_en">European Cluster Trend Report</a> and iKnow <a href="http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/">database</a>.</p>
        <p>Once all the trends and uncertainties have been identified, the second step is to assess their level of importance and the level of uncertainty. The assessment can be done in a workshop with regional partners or through a Delphi survey. When the assessment is done, all uncertainties are placed in a 2x2 matrix, which is an easy way to visualize the trends and identify the scenario axes from the most important and most uncertain factors placed in the right-hand upper corner of the matrix. This can be done either in the workshop or in the case of Delphi by RIS3 facilitators based on the Delphi result.</p>
        <p>The fourth step can be done by RIS3 facilitators. It is to describe the scenarios in a detail including a selection of a highly-descriptive title, compelling storylines and possibly a comparative table with information on the background of scenarios, related trends etc. Scenario building template offers guidance how to describe scenarios.</p>
        <p>The fifth step involves the consideration of the implications of scenarios and plan for preparatory actions. This can be done either in a workshop or through a Delphi survey. The most important thing is that all quadruple helix partners with a representative sample of different parties are taken in this work. Scenario building tool offers guidance as a set of questions that need to be answered to understand the implications of scenarios.</p>
        <p>Finally, one should incorporate the scenario building results in RIS3 work in priority setting, action plan implementation and monitoring and evaluation phases. Thus, the region can monitor whether the environmental development is going towards any of the scenarios, if so how and consider the related implications for RIS3 strategy.</p>
