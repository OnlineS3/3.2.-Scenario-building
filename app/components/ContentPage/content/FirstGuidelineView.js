        <h1>Guideline 1: Identifying trends and uncertainties</h1>
        <p>To form scenarios, it’s necessary to gather information about the future trends and uncertainties that could affect the region’s future. We suggest that the uncertainties should be gathered by using the PEST framework.</p>
        <h2>Gathering the data</h2>
        <p>The data about uncertainties and trends can be acquired in many different ways. It’s possible to hold workshops for the regional stakeholders and get their inputs to form an idea about what changing elements could be significant in the region’s future. Also, surveys for the aforementioned stakeholders could yield insights to important uncertainties.</p>
        <p>The uncertainties and trends can also be gathered via a literature search. There are plenty of international statistic data that can reveal underlying regional trends. There are also multiple organisations that map important global and more regional trends and future forecasts. See useful resources below for more detailed information.</p>
        <h2>Wildcards and weak signals as uncertainties</h2>
        <p>Foresight studies often use <a href="http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/what-is-a-weak-signal/">weak signals</a> and wildcards to understand what might happen in the future. They are thus a great tool for identifying uncertainties for the scenario building. Weak signals are patterns in the current time that could predict a certain future. For example, increasing self-medication is a weak signal that might convey more frequent undetected diseases and a rising risk for overdoses.</p>
        <p>Wildcards, on the other hand, are very unlikely situations that could change things in the world overnight. For example, a great earthquake or a fast-spreading pandemic could be a wild card for certain regions. The region could search for weak signals and wildcards through surveys, workshops or literature searches. Often there are local actors that make regional foresight analyses.</p>
        <h2>Using PEST to map uncertainties and trends</h2>
        <p>PEST-analysis is an analytical tool for strategic management which helps policy-makers to understand the macro-environment of the company. This approach is great also for regions to understand and map the uncertainties and trends. Moreover, regions can easily see what kind of uncertainties they have already mapped and which sectors might need further analyses. The PEST template can be used in mapping the regional uncertainties and trends.</p>

          <p>PEST- analysis is a framework for strategy makers to understand what kind of issues, challenges and other types of macro-environmental factors can affect the future of the region.</p>
          <p>While there are masses of information about all things that may affect regions in the future, it’s much easier to assess the factors once they are organised in trends, uncertainties and in the four PEST categories. This also makes it clear which factors are more important and which don’t pose such a great impact.</p>
          <h3>Political factors</h3>
          <p>Political factors are always related to the activities and decisions of the government, in the case of an EU region, the government can mean both the national government and the EU policies and actions.</p>
          <p>Questions to consider:</p>
          <p><em>Are there going to be great changes in tax policies? Labour laws? Environmental laws? </em><br /><em>Is the government stable in the future?</em><br /><em>What kind of impact will the government have on health, education and infrastructure in the region?</em><br /><em>How will the tariffs and trade restrictions develop in the future?</em></p>
          <h3>Environmental factors</h3>
          <p>Global warming, weather and other environmental factors pose great changes to economies worldwide. Especially regions with industries such as tourism, forestry, maritime and agriculture may be especially affected by environmental factors.</p>
          <p>Questions to consider:</p>
          <p><em>How will the global warming affect the region?</em><br /><em>Will international environmental issues result in great international migration?</em><br /><em>Is it necessary for the region to change its energy sources in the future?</em><br /><em>How are environmental factors going to affect the greatest industries in the region?</em></p>
          <h3>Social factors</h3>
          <p>Social factors include things related to common attitudes, culture and population. Social trends will affect greatly many aspects in the region. For example, the ageing population might indicate a smaller proportion of workforce (and rising labour costs!) and rising demand for health services.</p>
          <p>Questions to consider:</p>
          <p><em>What are the age distribution and population growth like in the future?</em><br /><em>Will people be more conscious of their health?</em><br /><em>Will there be a strong national culture in the future or will there be strong sub-cultures instead?</em><br /><em>What are people’s attitudes towards career choices, safety and domestic work like in the future?</em></p>
          <h3>Technological factors</h3>
          <p>Technological aspects include things like automation, R&amp;D activity and technological change related factors.</p>
          <p>Questions to consider:</p>
          <p><em>Will emerging technologies create new markets and opportunities for the region?</em><br /><em>Is automation going to replace many jobs in the future?</em><br /><em>Can the region benefit from innovations around an emerging technology?</em></p>
          <h2>Trends and uncertainties – What is the difference?</h2>
          <p>Trends and uncertainties are both factors that can affect the future of a region. The difference is in their certainty. Trends are almost definite things that can be forecasted from how things are right now. For example, urbanisation and digitalization are such trends.</p>
          <p>Uncertainties are more ambiguous. For example, it’s possible that there will be strong centralised, national cultures in the future, or there might be strong global subcultures that coexist in the region.</p>
          <h2>How to use the Online S3 PEST template</h2>
          <p>Our PEST-analysis template is easy to use. The template is a PDF file that may be filled in with an internet browser (at least Chrome and Internet Explorer support this) or with a PDF reader such as Adobe Acrobat or the iOS Preview.</p>
          <p>The visualisation of the PEST-analysis will be an easy to assess aid in communicating the scenario building process and discussing them to assess their impact. More about this in the second template of scenario building, the impact analysis.</p>
          <h2>The analysis can be more thorough</h2>
          <p>The PEST-analysis can be extended for regional needs especially if regional workshops/surveys/expert interviews/literature suggests that there are great underlying phenomena that don’t fall into any of the PEST categories.</p>
          <p>Often Legal and Economic factors are added to the PEST factors. Some areas could benefit from considering environmental factors such as weather and climate changes. Especially so if the region has strong agriculture or tourism.</p>
