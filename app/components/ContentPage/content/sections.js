    content: '<div><h1>Scenario building toolset</h1><p>The scenario building starts with the determination of the scope of the scenario work. In the context of RIS3, it may be how the nation/region will evolve in the next 20-30 years related to political, environmental, social and technological issues.</p><p>The application consists of three different sets of guidelines, which support regions to conduct scenario work. The application thus essentially assist regions to carry out scenario process.</p><p>The first set of guidelines supports regions to identify trends and uncertainties affecting regional development. It provides a list of data sources for regions to identify trends and uncertainties on the European level. The regions can use this data as the basis to identify further trends and uncertainties on the regional level.</p><p>The second set of guidelines supports to develop and describe a set of future scenarios. The basis for scenario development is derived from the identified future uncertainties. Regional stakeholders are to assess their level of importance and their level of uncertainty. This can be done through online Delphi application or in a workshop. Then, the region is to select the most important and uncertain uncertainties for the basis of scenarios. The guideline provides a set of questions that can be used to build scenarios in a way that they are consistently different, and to describe the different scenarios in a clear and appealing manner to raise the interest and the ability for regional stakeholders to assess them.</p><p>The third set of guidelines supports regions to assess the implications of scenarios. For this, it is possible to use online Delphi application or to conduct a regional workshop. The aim of the assessment is to support the region to prepare an action plan how to exploit the foreseen opportunities and to minimize risks. The guideline provides a set of questions that can be used to assess the implications of scenarios.</p></div><div><a href="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/figure-1.png" title=""><img src="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/figure-1.png" alt=""></a></div><div><h1>Scenario building process</h1><p>As a whole, scenario process involves the following 5 steps:</p><ol><li>Identify future trends and uncertainties (PEST analysis tool)</li><li>Assess the importance of each trend and uncertainty (Impact analysis tool)</li><li>Form scenarios (Scenario building tool)</li><li>Describe scenarios in-depth (Scenario description tool)</li><li>Assess scenario implications and plan for preparatory actions (Preparation plan tool)</li></ol><p>The Online S3 tools for scenario building support each of these steps. The steps are divided into three guidelines. Step 1 is described in Guideline 1, Steps 2 to 4 are described in Guideline 2 and Step 5 is described in Guideline 3. Hence, the three guidelines help with each stage in the scenario building process.</p>	<p>The first step is for RIS3 facilitators (regional planners) to formulate the scope for scenario building. Typically, this is related to how the region will develop during the next 20-30 years. Then the first step involves identifying key trends and uncertainties affecting regional development such as political, economic, social and technological issues. RIS3 facilitators can get this data from different ways through preparing a desktop research, a workshop or a Delphi survey targeted for regional specialists. Scenario building tool offers a list of data sources that support the collection of trends and uncertainties in European level such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cluster/observatory/european-cluster-trend-report_en">European Cluster Trend Report</a> and iKnow <a href="http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/">database</a>.</p><p>Once all the trends and uncertainties have been identified, the second step is to assess their level of importance and the level of uncertainty. The assessment can be done in a workshop with regional partners or through a Delphi survey. When the assessment is done, all uncertainties are placed in a 2x2 matrix, which is an easy way to visualize the trends and identify the scenario axes from the most important and most uncertain factors placed in the right-hand upper corner of the matrix. This can be done either in the workshop or in the case of Delphi by RIS3 facilitators based on the Delphi result.</p><p>The fourth step can be done by RIS3 facilitators. It is to describe the scenarios in a detail including a selection of a highly-descriptive title, compelling storylines and possibly a comparative table with information on the background of scenarios, related trends etc. Scenario building tool offers guidance how to describe scenarios.</p><p>The fifth step involves the consideration of the implications of scenarios and plan for preparatory actions. This can be done either in a workshop or through a Delphi survey. The most important thing is that all quadruple helix partners with a representative sample of different parties are taken in this work. Scenario building tool offers guidance as a set of questions that need to be answered to understand the implications of scenarios.</p><p>Finally, one should incorporate the scenario building results in RIS3 work in priority setting, action plan implementation and monitoring and evaluation phases. Thus, the region can monitor whether the environmental development is going towards any of the scenarios, if so how and consider the related implications for RIS3 strategy.</p></div>'

    content: '<div><h1>Guideline 1: Identifying trends and uncertainties</h1><p>To form scenarios, it’s necessary to gather information about the future trends and uncertainties that could affect the region’s future. We suggest that the uncertainties should be gathered by using the PEST framework.</p><h2>Gathering the data</h2><p>The data about uncertainties and trends can be acquired in many different ways. It’s possible to hold workshops for the regional stakeholders and get their inputs to form an idea about what changing elements could be significant in the region’s future. Also, surveys for the aforementioned stakeholders could yield insights to important uncertainties.</p><p>The uncertainties and trends can also be gathered via a literature search. There are plenty of international statistic data that can reveal underlying regional trends. There are also multiple organisations that map important global and more regional trends and future forecasts. See useful resources below for more detailed information.</p><h2>Wildcards and weak signals as uncertainties</h2><p>Foresight studies often use <a href="http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/what-is-a-weak-signal/">weak signals</a> and wildcards to understand what might happen in the future. They are thus a great tool for identifying uncertainties for the scenario building. Weak signals are patterns in the current time that could predict a certain future. For example, increasing self-medication is a weak signal that might convey more frequent undetected diseases and a rising risk for overdoses.</p><p>Wildcards, on the other hand, are very unlikely situations that could change things in the world overnight. For example, a great earthquake or a fast-spreading pandemic could be a wild card for certain regions. The region could search for weak signals and wildcards through surveys, workshops or literature searches. Often there are local actors that make regional foresight analyses.</p><h2>Using PEST to map uncertainties and trends</h2><p>PEST-analysis is an analytical tool for strategic management which helps policy-makers to understand the macro-environment of the company. This approach is great also for regions to understand and map the uncertainties and trends. Moreover, regions can easily see what kind of uncertainties they have already mapped and which sectors might need further analyses. The PEST template can be used in mapping the regional uncertainties and trends.</p></div></div><div><img src="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Pest_pdf_1.jpg" alt=""></div><div><div><p>PEST- analysis is a framework for strategy makers to understand what kind of issues, challenges and other types of macro-environmental factors can affect the future of the region.</p><p>While there are masses of information about all things that may affect regions in the future, it’s much easier to assess the factors once they are organised in trends, uncertainties and in the four PEST categories. This also makes it clear which factors are more important and which don’t pose such a great impact.</p><h3>Political factors</h3><p>Political factors are always related to the activities and decisions of the government, in the case of an EU region, the government can mean both the national government and the EU policies and actions.</p><p>Questions to consider:</p><p><em>Are there going to be great changes in tax policies? Labour laws? Environmental laws? </em><br><em>Is the government stable in the future?</em><br><em>What kind of impact will the government have on health, education and infrastructure in the region?</em><br><em>How will the tariffs and trade restrictions develop in the future?</em></p><h3>Environmental factors</h3><p>Global warming, weather and other environmental factors pose great changes to economies worldwide. Especially regions with industries such as tourism, forestry, maritime and agriculture may be especially affected by environmental factors.</p><p>Questions to consider:</p><p><em>How will the global warming affect the region?</em><br><em>Will international environmental issues result in great international migration?</em><br><em>Is it necessary for the region to change its energy sources in the future?</em><br><em>How are environmental factors going to affect the greatest industries in the region?</em></p><h3>Social factors</h3><p>Social factors include things related to common attitudes, culture and population. Social trends will affect greatly many aspects in the region. For example, the ageing population might indicate a smaller proportion of workforce (and rising labour costs!) and rising demand for health services.</p><p>Questions to consider:</p><p><em>What are the age distribution and population growth like in the future?</em><br><em>Will people be more conscious of their health?</em><br><em>Will there be a strong national culture in the future or will there be strong sub-cultures instead?</em><br><em>What are people’s attitudes towards career choices, safety and domestic work like in the future?</em></p><h3>Technological factors</h3><p>Technological aspects include things like automation, R&amp;D activity and technological change related factors.</p><p>Questions to consider:</p><p><em>Will emerging technologies create new markets and opportunities for the region?</em><br><em>Is automation going to replace many jobs in the future?</em><br><em>Can the region benefit from innovations around an emerging technology?</em></p><h2>Trends and uncertainties – What is the difference?</h2><p>Trends and uncertainties are both factors that can affect the future of a region. The difference is in their certainty. Trends are almost definite things that can be forecasted from how things are right now. For example, urbanisation and digitalization are such trends.</p><p>Uncertainties are more ambiguous. For example, it’s possible that there will be strong centralised, national cultures in the future, or there might be strong global subcultures that coexist in the region.</p><h2>How to use the Online S3 PEST tool</h2><p>Our PEST-analysis tool is easy to use. The tool is a PDF file that may be filled in with an internet browser (at least Chrome and Internet Explorer support this) or with a PDF reader such as Adobe Acrobat or the iOS Preview.</p><p>The visualisation of the PEST-analysis will be an easy to assess aid in communicating the scenario building process and discussing them to assess their impact. More about this in the second tool of scenario building, the impact analysis.</p><h2>The analysis can be more thorough</h2><p>The PEST-analysis can be extended for regional needs especially if regional workshops/surveys/expert interviews/literature suggests that there are great underlying phenomena that don’t fall into any of the PEST categories.</p><p>Often Legal and Economic factors are added to the PEST factors. Some areas could benefit from considering environmental factors such as weather and climate changes. Especially so if the region has strong agriculture or tourism.</p><h2>Useful resources for identifying uncertainties and trends</h2><p><a href="http://wiwe.iknowfutures.eu/what-is-a-weak-signal/">iKnow</a> – Database on wildcards and weak signals, unfortunately not updated recently</p><p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cluster/observatory/european-cluster-trend-report_en">European Cluster Trend Report</a></p><p><a href="http://www.thegff.com/">The Global Futures and Foresight – Reports on future studies</a></p><p><strong>Statistics Databases:</strong></p><p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat">Eurostat</a></p><p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/eu/">OECD Europe Statistics</a></p><p><a href="https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data">European Union Open Data Portal</a></p><p>The Internet is full of free statistics sites if they seem helpful.</p><p><strong>Commercial Software Tools for Foresight:</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.futuresplatform.com/">Futures Platform</a></p><p><a href="https://www.itonics.de/software/itonics-strategic-foresight/">ITONICS Software</a></p></div>'

    content: '<div><h1>Guideline 2: Developing scenarios</h1><div><p>This guideline helps regional policy-makers to turn the previously gathered trends and uncertainties into scenarios that will give great insight to how the future scenarios could be taken into account in RIS3.</p><p>The scenarios are build based on the uncertainties and trends listed in the previous PEST-tool. The uncertainties are assessed regarding their impact/importance for the region and their relative uncertainty in the Impact analysis tool. The Impact analysis tool requires regions to assess the levels of uncertainty and impact of each uncertainty. This can be done either through a regional workshop or a Delphi survey.</p><p>Then the most uncertain and important uncertainties are selected using the selected and Scenario building tool is used to form the scenarios. Here the idea is to form 4 distinct scenarios using two key uncertainties.</p><p>When the presumptions for different scenarios are ready, the scenarios are described in detail. This can be done by using the Scenario description tool. Clear and elaborative descriptions of the scenarios are a vital part in forming scenarios. Engaging scenarios will give more to think about and fascinate participants to think more about how the region should anticipate different possible futures.</p><h2>This is not the only way to form scenarios</h2><p>While our tools are helpful for forming scenarios, the above is not the only way in which scenarios can be built. The basic idea of having uncertainties and trends as the foundation of scenario building is the same with all scenario building styles.</p><h2>Impact analysis tool</h2><p>The Impact analysis tool is used to figure out which gathered uncertainties are the most important ones. The most important uncertainties will become the base of scenario building, thus it’s important to analyse all uncertainties in terms of uncertainty and impact.</p><h3>How uncertain and impactful the uncertainties are?</h3><p>At this point, after the PEST-analysis and data gathering, there should be quite a number of uncertainties to assess. All the uncertainties are assessed in terms of their uncertainty and impact on the region.</p><p><strong>Uncertainty</strong></p><p>Uncertainty is high in those uncertainties which could have almost any outcome – and the outcome in the future cannot be predicted with the current knowledge. When uncertainties are high, it’s especially important to think about how to prepare for the possible outcomes.</p><p>In our tool the uncertainty is measured on a scale of 0 to 10. 10 means that the outcome of an uncertainty is not at all sure with the current knowledge and 0 meaning that the outcome is predictable. Thus, uncertainties with the uncertainty level of 0 are not really uncertain at all and they should be called trends instead.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong></p><p>Some uncertainties don’t affect much the region whichever the outcome. Thus, it’s not much use to assess these in the scenario building. Instead, some uncertainties can pose great opportunities or be detrimental to the region.</p><p>In the Impact analysis tool, the impact is likewise measured on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 being completely indifferent and 10 conveying the greatest impact possible.</p><h3>How should the impact/uncertainty assessment be done?</h3><p>This impact/uncertainty assessment should take regional actors’ opinions into account. It’s highly recommended to utilise workshops or Delphi surveys in determining the levels of impact and uncertainty because regional actors and experts most likely have the most up to data insights on the uncertainties. This is also a great way to engage RIS3 stakeholders in the RIS3 process.</p><p>It might also be beneficial to map the identified trends in the impact analysis tool as well. The trends should be somewhat certain and score low in uncertainty. However, the impact of the trends for the region might vary greatly. Thus, the trends that have a great impact could be selected as presumptions for all scenarios in the next tool.</p><h3>Which uncertainties should be taken into scenarios?</h3><p>The most impactful and uncertain uncertainties are the most important uncertainties that should be selected to building scenarios. Two of them should be then selected for the scenario building.</p><p>If there are multiple uncertainties that could be selected (as there most likely will be) the scenario building facilitators may select the most appropriate ones.</p><p>The below Figure 5 shows how uncertainties and trends should be seen in the impact analysis tool. Important uncertainties are those that should be incorporated in the scenario building presumptions.</p></div></div><div><a href="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Importance-analysis-example.png" title=""><img src="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Importance-analysis-example.png" alt=""></a></div><div><div><h2>Scenario building tool</h2><p>Scenario building tool helps with visualising the presumptions for each scenario. In this scenario building approach, 4 distinct scenarios are built with two uncertainties. There are other types of approaches as well, see more from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adgo/scenario-building-workshop-how-to-build-and-use-scenarios">here</a>.</p><p>When the two main uncertainties are selected, they are put on a matrix. Our tool requires the naming of both uncertainties and writing short descriptions of what the outcome possibilities for each uncertainty are.</p></div></div><div><a href="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Scenario-building1.png" title=""><img src="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Scenario-building1.png" alt=""></a></div><div><div><h3>What are extreme outcomes?</h3><p>Extreme outcomes for each uncertainty are what could happen in the extreme case with the uncertainty. The point is not to make these outcomes still credible in the decided time frame.</p><p>For example, if regional safety is the uncertainty possible outcomes could be (1) greatly lowered safety in terms of terrorism, IT security and the number of conflicts and (2) improved safety with fewer security problems, terrorism and conflicts due to improved international collaboration against terrorism and conflicts and improved IT security.</p><p>When you make combinations of different uncertainty outcomes, you end up with 4 distinct presumptions for the scenarios.</p><h2>Scenario description tool</h2><p>Scenario description tool can be used to form detailed descriptions for the scenarios, building on the presumptions from the Scenario Building tool. However, to form more elaborative scenario descriptions, it’s advised to use a richer media (such as PowerPoint slides for example) than the Scenario Description templates. This template is none-the-less great for initial scenario descriptions.</p><p>Like the previous PDF tools, Scenario Description tool can be filled in in most PDF readers, editors and in most internet browsers. There are two types of Scenario Description tool templates, one with only text fields and another with one image field per scenario.</p></div></div><div><a href="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Scenario-description3.1..png" title=""><img src="http://www.s3platform.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Scenario-description3.1..png" alt=""></a></div><div><div><h3>Elaborative Scenarios</h3><p>It’s important that scenarios are elaborative and interesting. The more intriguing the scenarios are, the more they tease out creative thinking, solutions and preparation plans in the next phase. Thus, good scenarios should include storylines and detailed portrayals of what life is like in the region in the scenario.</p><p>This elaboration should also include visualisations of the scenarios. So the description could actually include images, comics, videos and other kinds of visual aids.</p><h3>Checklist for Scenarios</h3><p><em>Are the scenarios plausible?</em><br><em> Is there a logical chain of events that would lead to each of the scenarios?</em><br><em>If the scenarios really happen, what else needs to happen?</em> (For example, if the scenario is based on the presumption that there will be more internet security problems it’s necessary to incorporate a reason for that)<br><em>Are the scenarios internally consistent?</em> There shouldn’t be any events or drivers that exclude one another.</p><p><em>Are the scenarios differentiated from one another?</em></p><p><em>Do scenarios challenge the conventional thinking or are they somewhat unsurprising?</em><br>Scenarios should shed light on unconventional possibilities and help the region to prepare for things that are not already expected.</p><p><em>Are the scenario titles descriptive?</em></p><p><em>Are the storylines fascinating?</em></p><p><em>Are there any visual materials to elaborate the scenarios?</em></p><p>It’s also beneficial to do an actor analysis in this step. So think about different stakeholders in the scenario and assess their interests. Are there groups of people who benefit or would drive this scenario? If a scenario is the worst option for all interest groups it’s not very likely to be a plausible scenario.</p><p>Note here that scenarios shouldn’t be assessed regarding their probability. Thus, there shouldn’t be any probabilities or probability analyses in the scenario descriptions.</p><h2>Resources – Read more about scenario building</h2><p><a href="http://forlearn.jrc.ec.europa.eu/guide/4_methodology/meth_scenario.htm">The JRC European Commission FOR-LEARN Guide for Scenario Building</a></p><p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adgo/scenario-building-workshop-how-to-build-and-use-scenarios">Scenario Building Workshop – How to Build and Use Scenarios by Adam Gordon</a></p><p><a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140108141323/http:/www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/horizon-scanning-centre/foresight_scenario_planning.pdf">Scenario Planning Guide by the Government Office of Science (UK)</a></p></div>'

    content: '<div><h1>Guideline 3: Implications of scenarios</h1><div><p>Scenarios shouldn’t be made just for the sake of making scenarios.
